## Problem 2 (Homicide Dataset)

``` r
# Import the dataset
homicide_raw <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"), na = c("", "NA", "Unknown"))
# Clean dataset and Create variables city_state, resolved;Omit cities without victim race reports and error city;Limit victim_race to white or black
homicide_df = homicide_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character(reported_date), format = "%Y%m%d"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White"),
         city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
         resolved = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
           disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ 0,
           disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1)) %>% 
  relocate(city_state) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX","Phoenix, AZ","Kansas City, MO","Tulsa, AL"),
         victim_race %in% c("White","Black"))
```
